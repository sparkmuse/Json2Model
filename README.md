# Json2Model

## About

Json2Model (aka Broccoli) is a small little tool to help to automate the creation of Models from JSON files so you do not have to suffer :)

## Goals
- Ability to create Model classes from the files.
- Nested classes will be created as well.
- Multi-language support (programing language anyway).
- Data type deduction.

## Install
- Download or clone repository.
- Navigate to folder ````/Json2Model/bin/````
- Run the ````j2m.sh```` from the command line.

Note: Make sure that the file has permission to run in your computer.

## Documentation 
- Navigate to he cloned/downloaded repository
- Go to folder ````Json2Model/doc````
- Open the file ````/overview-summary.html```` to read the documentation
- Command line documentation.

 -h,--help                 Help

                           files. If ommited the same DIR as 'file' is
                           used

## User Guides
I want to get a Model 'Input' file from input.json file to follow MVC patters.

input.json contains:
````json
{
	"customer":{
		"firstName": "John",
		"lastName": "Doe"
	},
	"addresses": [
		{
			"street": "Faraway Creek",
			"number": 1234,
			"city":	"Never-land"
		}
	],
	"balance": 23234.23,
	"active": true
}
````

- Just run this to test.
````
./j2m.sh -f "myDirectory/Box.json" -lang=java -o "/myDirectory/target/"
````

- New files was created in the specified directory:

````java
public class Input {

	private ArrayList<Address> addresses;
	private double balance;
	private boolean active;
	private Customer customer;

	public Input(ArrayList<Address> addresses, double balance, boolean active, Customer customer) {
		super();
		this.addresses = addresses;
		this.balance = balance;
		this.active = active;
		this.customer = customer;
	}

	public void load() {
		//TODO: Needs to be implemented.
	}

	public ArrayList<Address> getAddresses() {
		return addresses;
	}
	public void setAddresses(ArrayList<Address> addresses) {
		this.addresses = addresses;
	}
	public double getBalance() {
		return balance;
	}
	public void setBalance(double balance) {
		this.balance = balance;
	}
	public boolean isActive() {
		return active;
	}
	public void setActive(boolean active) {
		this.active = active;
	}
	public Customer getCustomer() {
		return customer;
	}
	public void setCustomer(Customer customer) {
		this.customer = customer;
	}
}

public class Customer {

	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;

	public Customer(String firstName, String lastName) {
		super();
		this.firstName = firstName;
		this.lastName = lastName;
	}

	public String getFirstName() {
		return firstName;
	}
	public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
		this.firstName = firstName;
	}
	public String getLastName() {
		return lastName;
	}
	public void setLastName(String lastName) {
		this.lastName = lastName;
	}
}

public class Address {

	private int number;
	private String city;
	private String street;

	public Address(int number, String city, String street) {
		super();
		this.number = number;
		this.city = city;
		this.street = street;
	}

	public int getNumber() {
		return number;
	}
	public void setNumber(int number) {
		this.number = number;
	}
	public String getCity() {
		return city;
	}
	public void setCity(String city) {
		this.city = city;
	}
	public String getStreet() {
		return street;
	}
	public void setStreet(String street) {
		this.street = street;
	}
}
